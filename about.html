            <h4>FrontEnd Developer</h4>
            <p>I am a dedicated Software Developer currently pursuing my Master's degree at TU Chemnitz. Previously, I had the invaluable opportunity to undertake an internship at John Deere in Zweibrucken, where I honed my skills in various aspects of software development. Throughout this experience, I delved into C programming, mastered the art of designing and implementing user interfaces for John Deere's GUI, delved into CAN bus communication, and gained valuable insights into Actuators simulation and ECU. It was during this internship that I discovered my passion for user interface design and fostering effective communication between software and users. Eager to expand my skill set, I independently learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online resources like YouTube, engaging in practical projects to solidify my understanding. With a steadfast commitment to continuous growth and a clear vision of working as a Software Developer, I am enthusiastic about contributing my expertise to innovative projects and evolving alongside a dynamic company.</p>
